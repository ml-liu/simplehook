vacall - C functions called with variable arguments

This library allows C functions to be called with variable arguments and
to return variable return values. This is much like the varargs(3) facility,
but also allows the return value to be specified at run time.

A typical use is the implementation of call-back functions in embedded
interpreters.


Installation instructions:

    Configure the parent directory. Then:
        cd vacall
        make
        make check
        make install

This subdirectory produces a static library. Reason:
The vacall-*.c files access global variables. Such accesses causes
portability problems when combined with the option -fPIC (because of
the small/medium/large memory models and platform dependent assembler
syntax to access the GOT).
Therefore Makefile.devel in this directory compiles the files without -fPIC.
Therefore the resulting object files are not suitable for being put into
a shared library.
Therefore this direcory must
  - either not use libtool,
  - or pass '-static' to $(LIBTOOL_LINK) when creating libvacall.la.
