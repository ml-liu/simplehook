libffcall - foreign function call libraries

This is a library which can be used to build foreign function call interfaces
in embedded interpreters.


Installed libraries and header files:

    It installs a library libffcall.{a,so}; to link with it, use the compiler
    option '-lffcall'.

    It consists of two parts:
      * avcall - calling C functions with variable arguments.
        Its include file is <avcall.h>.
      * callback - closures with variable arguments as first-class C functions.
        Its include file is <callback.h>.

    Additionally, you can determine the libffcall version by including
    <ffcall-version.h>.

    For backward compatibility with versions 1.x, libraries libavcall.{a,so}
    and libcallback.{a,so} are installed as well. But they are deprecated;
    use libffcall.{a,so} instead.


Installation instructions:

        mkdir builddir
        cd builddir
        ../configure --cache-file=config.cache
        make
        make check
        make install
