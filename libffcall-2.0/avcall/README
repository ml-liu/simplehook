avcall - calling C functions with variable arguments

This library allows arbitrary C functions to be called from embedded
interpreters, debuggers, RPC calls, etc, by building up a C
argument-list incrementally from explicitly typed arguments. This 
considerably reduces the amount of boilerplate glue code required
for such applications.

The interface is like stdargs/varargs in reverse and is intended to be as
portable as possible, however the details of function calling are highly
machine-dependent so your mileage may vary. At the very least there are
typically built-in limits on the size of the argument-list. The
argument-pushing macros all return 0 for success, < 0 for error (eg,
arg-list overflow).
